# 🎉 EA FC 26 Squad Builder v2.0.0 Release

## 🚀 What's New

This is a **major release** with revolutionary improvements to metarating handling, scraping performance, and squad optimization!

### 🌟 Headline Features

#### 1. Multi-Position Metaratings 📊
Players can now have **different metaratings for different positions**! A striker who can also play winger will have separate scores for ST, LW, and RW.

**Before:**
```json
{
  "name": "Mbappé",
  "metarating": 95.2,
  "metarating_position": "ST"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "name": "Mbappé",
  "metaratings": {
    "ST": {"score": 95.2},
    "LW": {"score": 93.1},
    "RW": {"score": 92.8}
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ More accurate squad building
- ✅ Better position versatility
- ✅ Smarter player selection

#### 2. Async Concurrent Scraping ⚡
Scraping is now **up to 60% faster** with async concurrent requests!

- 🔥 **10 concurrent requests** instead of sequential
- 🎯 **Intelligent rate limiting** to avoid API blocks
- 📦 **Bulk processing** with semaphore control
- ⚙️ **ThreadPoolExecutor** for optimal performance

**Scraping times:**
- 5 pages: ~45 seconds (was ~2 minutes)
- 50 pages: ~8 minutes (was ~20 minutes)
- Full database: ~15 minutes (was ~40 minutes)

#### 3. No More Duplicate Players 🎯
Fixed the annoying bug where players with multiple card versions appeared twice!

**Example Fix:**
```
❌ Before:
6   CDM    Georgia Stanway    82.5
7   CDM    Georgia Stanway    84.6  // Same player!

✅ After:
6   CDM    Georgia Stanway    84.6  // Only best version
7   CDM    Declan Rice        82.1  // Different player
```

#### 4. Smart Position Filtering ��
Scraper only fetches metaratings for positions players can actually play!

**Example:**
- Striker with alt positions [LW, RW]: Gets ST, LW, RW metaratings ✅
- **No longer stores** CDM, GK metaratings for strikers ❌

**Benefits:**
- 💾 ~40% less data stored per player
- 🚀 Faster queries
- 🎯 More accurate optimization

#### 5. Enhanced Club Tracking 📝
Userscript now tracks **tradeable status** and **player names**!

**New Features:**
- ✅ Accurate untradeable detection (multiple methods)
- ✅ Player name storage
- ✅ Market value calculator endpoint
- ✅ Tradeable vs untradeable statistics

**New API Endpoint:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/my-club/value
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "total_value": 1500000,
  "tradeable_count": 50,
  "untradeable_count": 100,
  "players_with_prices": 45
}
```
