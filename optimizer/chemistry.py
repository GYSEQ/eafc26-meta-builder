EA FC 26 Chemistry Calculation - Squad-Threshold System

Chemistry is based on how many teammates share the same club/league/nation.
Icons and Heroes get special bonuses and count double toward certain thresholds.

Rules:
- Players earn chemistry based on teammate counts (not individual links)
- Icons: Full chemistry + count double for nationality thresholds
- Heroes: Full chemistry + count double for league thresholds
- Max chemistry per player: 3 points
- Max squad chemistry: 33 points (11 players Ã— 3)
